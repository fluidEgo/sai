## IDEA TITLE

### Proposed Solution (Describe your Idea/Solution/Prototype)
- The SAI Talent Assessment App is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that enables athletes, especially in rural areas, to record and upload videos of fitness tests (e.g., vertical jump, sit-ups, push-ups, running).
- It uses on-device AI/ML (MediaPipe, OpenCV) for real-time analysis, cheat detection, and auto-segmentation of reps.
- Data is securely encrypted (AES-256) and submitted to SAI servers via Flask API, with Aadhaar eKYC for verification and OCR for certificate parsing.
- Features gamified UI (badges, leaderboards benchmarked against famous athletes), voice instructions/mental games (Web Speech API), and location-based alerts (Geolocation).
- Officials' dashboard allows viewing encrypted data with filters.

- Detailed explanation of the proposed solution
- Athletes download the PWA, perform tests with voice guidance, get AI analysis (e.g., jump height, stride count), earn badges, and submit encrypted profiles.
- Blockchain mints NFT certificates post-analysis for verifiable authenticity (future implementation).
- Predictive ML forecasts potential and injury risks (future implementation).
- Wearables sync biometrics for holistic metrics (future implementation).
- Community-driven crowdsourcing allows peer scouting via shared videos (future implementation).

- How it addresses the problem
- Democratizes access by working offline on low-end devices, solving infrastructure constraints in rural India.
- Ensures authenticity with AI cheat detection and Aadhaar, preventing fraud.
- Enhances engagement via gamification and mental games.
- Location alerts connect users to competitions, uncovering hidden talents.

- Innovation and uniqueness of the solution
- First app combining on-device AI, AES encryption, and voice interfaces for Indian rural talent scouting.
- Unique gamification with famous athlete benchmarks and mental assessments in regional languages.
- Future expansions like blockchain tokenization and predictive analytics add scalability for community funding and injury prevention.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH

- Technologies to be used (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, hardware)
- Frontend: React.js (CDN), Tailwind CSS, CryptoJS (AES), Tesseract.js (OCR), Web Speech/Geolocation/MediaRecorder APIs.
- Backend: Flask, SQLite, Flask-CORS, PyCryptodome.
- AI/ML: Python, MediaPipe, OpenCV, NumPy, Pyodide.
- PWA: Service Worker, Web Manifest.
- Hardware: Phone camera (for video), browser APIs (for voice/location).

- Methodology and process for implementation (Flow Charts/Images/ working prototype)
- **User Flow**: Register with Aadhaar (eKYC) → Record video with voice instructions → AI analyzes (situp_counter.py via Pyodide) → Gamify results (badges) → Encrypt/submit data (AES) → View in dashboard.
- **Prototype**: Local run with `http-server` & `python app.py`; deployed on Vercel/Render.
- (Insert Flow Chart: User → Video → AI → Encryption → Submission → Dashboard)
- Future: Integrate blockchain (Web3.py) for certificates, TensorFlow.js for predictions, Web Bluetooth for wearables, and community upload features.

## FEASIBILITY AND VIABILITY

- Analysis of the feasibility of the idea
- Technical: Lightweight AI (Pyodide) runs on entry-level phones; blockchain/wearables as future add-ons are scalable.
- Economic: Free deployment (Vercel/Render); tokenized funding (future) reduces SAI costs.
- Scalable: PWA handles 100K+ users offline; Flask/SQLite for backend.

- Potential challenges and risks
- Privacy: Aadhaar/blockchain data risks breaches—mitigated by AES and consent.
- Connectivity: Rural low-bandwidth—addressed by offline PWA.
- Adoption: Tech literacy—solved with voice interfaces.
- Regulatory: Blockchain tokens as securities—use compliant platforms.
- AI Accuracy: False positives—refine with more data.

- Strategies for overcoming these challenges
- Security Audits: Use open-source tools (e.g., Mythril for smart contracts).
- User Testing: Pilot in rural areas for feedback.
- Partnerships: Collaborate with SAI for data validation and UIDAI for eKYC.
- Fallbacks: Mock modes for offline/blockchain (local storage).
- Scalability: Migrate to cloud ML (AWS SageMaker) for heavy loads.

## IMPACT AND BENEFITS

- Potential impact on the target audience
- Empowers 1M+ rural athletes with accessible scouting, uncovering hidden talents (e.g., 20% increase in identified prospects).
- Coaches/SAI officials gain real-time dashboards for efficient evaluation, reducing scouting time by 50%.

- Benefits of the solution (social, economic, environmental, etc.)
- **Social**: Inclusive scouting bridges urban-rural gap; mental games promote well-being.
- **Economic**: Crowdsourcing (future) reduces SAI costs; tokenized funding (future) democratizes opportunities.
- **Environmental**: Low-energy AI and digital certificates cut paper use; gamified challenges encourage eco-friendly fitness.
- **Health**: Predictive injury prevention (future) lowers risks; biometrics (future) enable personalized training.
